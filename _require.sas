/* _REQUIRE Documentation
    Checks all parameters for the string REQUIRED.  If it is
    found, then ABEND the SAS program.  This is used to check
    for NAMED Parameters that are REQUIRED, i.e. default to
    REQUIRED, but not given a value when called.  For example,
    a SAS program like the following will abend since OUT=
    defaults to REQUIRED, but it is not provided a value:
    %_DECODA(INFILE=aIndex.txt);
    This is due to the following code which is included in
    _DECODA:
    %_REQUIRE(&OUT);

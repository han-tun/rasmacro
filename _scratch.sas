/* _SCRATCH Documentation 
    
    Returns the name of the next temporary SAS DATASET that will be
    created, i.e. DATAn.  But, it does not create the SAS DATASET
    which is left up to the user; it is assumed that the creation will
    occur immediately otherwise DATAn may arise in some other way and
    unintended consequences result.  However, even immediate creation
    is not always foolproof since some PROCs have a nasty side effect
    of destroying the next DATAn and even previous ones,
    i.e. DATA1-DATA(n-1).  The only workaround for these braindead 
    PROCs is to change the root of the temporary SAS DATASET names 
    via ROOT=, see below.  
    
    NAMED Parameters 
    
    ROOT=WORK   Default naming scheme
    START=1     Defaults to starting with DATA1

/* _IFELSE Documentation
    Take care of boolean expressions with equal signs in them.  When 
    used as positional parameters, they will be flagged as invalid 
    macro parameter names.  Either use named parameters or wrap them 
    in an %eval( ).
            
    POSITIONAL Parameters  
            
    ARG1             condition to be evaluated
       
    ARG2             if ARG1 is true, then this
            
    ARG3             if ARG1 is false, then this

    NAMED Parameters

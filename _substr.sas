/* _SUBSTR Documentation
    This is a fault-tolerant version of %SUBSTR which handles 
    special cases like ARG1 being nothing which returns nothing,
    ARG2 greater than the length of ARG1 which returns nothing,
    etc.
            
    POSITIONAL Parameters  
            
    ARG1    string of characters to be subset
       
    ARG2    number representing the beginning of the subset
            
    ARG3    if any, the number of characters in the subset
*/

I don't know markdown nor want to learn ;o)

These are SAS macros that I have been developing for more than a
decade.  I have made attempts to share them in the past, but this
is the first public repo.  Mainly, this is to coordinate my own 
work which has ballooned to multiple servers.  But, since all of
the code is GPL, it was past time to let it all out.
